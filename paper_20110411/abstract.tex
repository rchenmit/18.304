% This is abstract.tex

%The abstract should be a brief summary of your results that grabs the
%reader's attention.  It is the first thing the reader will see, and you
%must convince the reader that the rest of your paper is worthwhile.  In
%the best of all possible worlds, \LaTeX\ will take care of all the
%formatting for you.  Let $v = (v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n)$.  If your
%abstract contains nothing but words, no one would know that you're using
%\LaTeX!


We provide an introduction to planar graphs, and show the conditions under which a graph is planar when the graph does not contain $K_{3,3}$ or $K_5$ as a minor. Kuratowski's theorem is used to show this.
