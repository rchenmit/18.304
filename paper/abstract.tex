%The abstract should be a brief summary of your results that grabs the
%reader's attention.  It is the first thing the reader will see, and you
%must convince the reader that the rest of your paper is worthwhile.  In
%the best of all possible worlds, \LaTeX\ will take care of all the
%formatting for you.  Let $v = (v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n)$.  If your

Orthophosphates and dissolved oxygen are crucial for supporting aquatic wildlife.  Water samples were collected from the Charles River on a typical winter day. The concentration of orthophosphate and phosphorus were determined with a colorimetric assay using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The dissovled oxygen content of the Charles River was determined with a modified Molybdate Blue titration protocol. The concentration of orthophosphate was determined to be 0.1864mg/L, and the concentration of phosphorus was 0.1114mg/L. Both of these values fall within expected, previously calculated ranges. The dissovled oxyten concentration was determined to be 14.556mg/L, which corresponds with a percent DO saturation of $103.73\%$. The orthophosphate and DO content of the Charles River show that the river is capable of support aquatic life and eutrophication.
